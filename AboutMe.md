About Me
I grew up in Jamaica which can be really challenging. I have many scars and broken bones to prove it.
After leaving High School at age 16yrs I became independent , working for my first boss at a construction company.
Her name was Bernadette Chin, she took me in as her son. I soon missed home and resigned.
In Jamaica most of my working years has been centered around the hotel industry.
In between I also worked in the records department of a hospital and as a security guard for four years.
I have three sisters, and my Mom is still alive and well. All here in America with me.
My mother showed incredible determination in bringing my family and I to America, a process that took her 12 years.
I am also a proud parent to a son who serves in the army, embodying the same strength and dedication that seems to run in the family.

My Role Models - The Men WHo Shaped My Psychy
My Grandfather served in Guantanamo Bay. He was quiet and unassuming, hard worker. Never disagreeing with my Grandmother.
My late father played a part in shaping my life story. One day he said to me "I trust no one, not even you." He is dead now, and now I miss him. He made me self sufficient, I am never afraid to try new things. To move on, from anything, is easy. So I have never settled long enough.
In a bad way, He made me sceptical. So I trust no one and don't believe in luck, only input will pay. Father time and mother Earth will have their way. Trust only God.
A big influence was Pablo , a Rastafarian who taught me how to appreciate life and how to genuinely love people. He was a people person.

Me
I am easily bored, and I realized that as I got older I am not able to read for long periods anymore.
I am happy for podcasts and ebooks on Spotify . Listening to the human voice is very comforting to me.
I miss Jamaica , I miss hanging out at the corner shop talking to friends and strangers til late in the night.
Drinking white rum .
I have no friends in America. Only my Mom, Son and Sisters. It's lonely here, but I'm brave. I must be brave.

"The next chapter of my life is always more interesting than the last one.” —Michael Lipsey.
This is so true, these are words I have lived by. It's never over til the fat lady sings.
I don't know the song, but I know she hasn't sung it yet.

I read that quote on Google, the internet has so much knowledge. For example GIT is all over Youtube, I follow this content creator called SMolJames. He has a great way of explaining this topic. I pointed all of this out to say that wew are living in a time when there are great possibilities. With infinte knowledge at our finger tips. Better than the days of BASIC or QBasic (only 1980s kids will know what I'm talking about). LOL!! (me getting with the times)

My Interests
I find solace in my own company, I live trouble free and I try to keep my mind clear. I have very few interests, I'd rather go to bed.
With that said , I'd say I am interested in ;

the Human being. People are mezmerizing.
Technology ; of all kind. Machinery is amazing, AI all of it.
Differnt Types of Music ; I love all music. I think music is speech to your heart and neverves. Hear music you love and you feel it in your skin.
Websites I Find interesting
Youtube It has a lot of valuable information, not just short form videos. I listen to;
Ted Talks
Interviews of CEOs , Execs, People with real guidance to help you develop your mind, etc.
History
Documentary
Even books, like Animal Farm by George Orwell. This is a beautiful book, very deep. A must read.
Spotify, I use the app. It has more music than I know what to do with. Beautiful invention, much better than Napster.
I like listening to podcasts too... like Joe Rogan
Also I found Robinhood (investment), don't know much. Learning little at a time.
Here is my Spotify playlist , also on Spotify my current book. The name of the book is Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.. It is nice to listen to someone read.

All of this I found out on the internet, not at a physical library or the record store.
Oh, how times have changed, and will keep changing. Even faster now with the advent of AI. I used AI to fix my errors in this assignment.
