## About Me
 I grew up in Jamaica which can be really challenging.  I have many scars and broken bones.
After leaving High School at age 16 I became independent , working for my first boss at a construction company.   
In Jamaica most of my working years has been centered around the hotel industry.   
In between I also worked in the records department of a hospital and as a security guard for four years.  
I have three sisters, and my Mom is still alive and well. All here in America with me.  
My mother showed incredible determination in bringing my family and I to America, a process that took her 12 years.  
I am also a proud parent to a son who serves in the army, embodying the same strength and dedication that seems to run in the family.  
My Grandfather served in Guantanamo Bay. My late father played a part in shaping my life story.  
He made me self sufficient, and in a bad way made me sceptical.  
Where as I don't believe in luck, only input will pay. And Earth will have her way. 
I am easily bored, and I realized that as I got older I am not able to read for long periods anymore.  
I am happy for podcasts and ebooks on [Spotify](www.spotify.com) . Listsening to the human voice is very comforting to me.
I miss Jamaica , I miss hanging out at the corner shop talking to friends til late in the night.  
Drinking *white rum* . I have **no** friends in America. Only my Mom, Son and Sisters.

I read that on Google, the internet has so much knowledge. For example GIT is all over Youtube, I follow this content   
creator called [SMolJames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb3lOiukwAQ). He has a great way of explaining this topic.
I pointed all of this out to say that wew are living in a time when there are great possibilities.
Better than the days of BASIC or QBasic.
