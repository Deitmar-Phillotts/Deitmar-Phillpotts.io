    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <body>

        <p>Growing up in Jamaica presented me with significant challenges, marked by physical scars and broken bones from a tough environment, yet it shaped my resilience and independence. <br>
            I left high school at sixteen and began working in construction before moving through roles in Jamaica’s hotel industry, a hospital records department, and as a security guard.<br>
             My mother’s unwavering determination brought my two sisters, my son and me to America after twelve years of effort. Testament to the strength that runs in our family—strength I see reflected in my son, who serves in the army. <br>
             Influenced by my quiet,  skeptical late father who taught me self-reliance,  I carry a complex mix of toughness and hope.<br>
             Despite missing Jamaica—the late-night talks and the sense of community—I’ve faced loneliness in America with only my family by my side, pushing me to be brave every day.

            Now, as a college student learning coding and web development, I feel a spark of excitement and opportunity that I wish I could share with others.<br>
            The modern world, with its internet, podcasts, ebooks, and AI like Grok, fills me with awe and gratitude—it’s knowledge at my fingertips, a chance to build a better life for myself and my family.<br>
            Though the past in Jamaica was rough and the present sometimes shaky, I see a light at the end of the tunnel: a future where I can take charge of my destiny.<br>
                America, for all its isolation, offers me this moment to grow, to learn, and to dream of a stability I’ve never settled for before.<br>
            It’s been a hard road, and at times I feel the weight of it deeply, but right now, I’m hopeful—ready to cry not just from pain, but from the promise of what’s ahead.</p>
