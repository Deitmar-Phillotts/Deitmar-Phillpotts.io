    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <body>

        <p>Growing up in Jamaica presented me with significant challenges, marked by physical scars and broken bones from a tough environment, yet it shaped my resilience and independence. <br>
            I left high school at sixteen and began working in construction under Bernadette Chin, who treated me like a son, before moving through roles in Jamaica’s hotel industry, a hospital records department, and as a security guard.<br>
             My mother’s unwavering determination brought my three sisters and me to America after twelve years of effort, a testament to the strength that runs in our family—strength I see reflected in my son, who serves in the army. <br>
             Influenced by my quiet, hardworking grandfather who served in Guantanamo Bay, my skeptical late father who taught me self-reliance, and Pablo, a Rastafarian who showed me how to love life and people, I carry a complex mix of toughness and hope.<br>
             Despite missing Jamaica—the late-night talks at the corner shop, the white rum, and the sense of community—I’ve faced loneliness in America with only my family by my side, pushing me to be brave every day.

            Now, as a college student learning coding and web development, I feel a spark of excitement and opportunity that I wish I could share with others.<br>
            The modern world, with its internet, podcasts, ebooks, and AI like Grok, fills me with awe and gratitude—it’s knowledge at my fingertips, a chance to build a better life for myself and my family.<br>
            Though the past in Jamaica was rough and the present sometimes shaky, I see a light at the end of the tunnel: a future where I can take charge of my destiny.<br>
            I am easily bored and struggle to read for long, but listening to the human voice soothes me, connecting me to others even in solitude.<br>
            America, for all its isolation, offers me this moment to grow, to learn, and to dream of a stability I’ve never settled for before.<br>
            It’s been a hard road, and at times I feel the weight of it deeply, but right now, I’m hopeful—ready to cry not just from pain, but from the promise of what’s ahead.</p>
